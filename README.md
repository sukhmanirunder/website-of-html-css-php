Website Project
This is a full-stack website I built during my second semester to practice web development. It includes user authentication, database connectivity, and basic interactivity.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS (styling & animations), JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL (or your database type)

Features
Sign-Up Page: Collects user data and inserts it into the database.

Login Page: Verifies user credentials and ensures valid registration.

Styling & Animations: CSS animations for better user experience.

Goals for Improvement
I want to make this website more interactive, visually appealing, and useful for real-world applications. Planned enhancements include:

Responsive design for mobile devices

Improved UI/UX

Additional features (e.g., dashboards, profiles)

Better security and data handling

Feedback & Suggestions
I’m looking for ideas to enhance this project. If you have suggestions for features, design improvements, or best practices, please share them!
